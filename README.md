## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fahim Anjum, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF passionate about signal processing, neuroscience, and machine learning(ML). I am particularly interested in applying signal processing aspects in ML such as Diffusion and large language models (LLMs).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing innovative deep-learning models for classifying and interpreting brain signals, with a focus on neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about scalable architectures in LLMs and their application in healthcare.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that intersect ML, neuroscience, and signal processing.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m actively seeking job opportunities where I can apply my expertise in ML and brain signal processing.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ML, deep learning architectures, or how to get started with EEG signal processing.
