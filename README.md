## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fahim Anjum, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF passionate about machine learning, particularly in brain signal processing and large language models (LLMs).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing innovative deep-learning models for classifying and interpreting brain signals, with a focus on neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about scalable architectures in LLMs and their application in healthcare.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that intersect machine learning, neuroscience, and healthcare.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m actively seeking job opportunities where I can apply my expertise in machine learning and brain signal processing.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about machine learning, deep learning architectures, or how to get started with EEG signal processing.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Fahim
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m fascinated by the parallels between neural networks and the human brain â€“ itâ€™s what drives my research every day!
